# `cursor` adapter

The bundled `cursor` adapter maps the v1 IR concept set to Cursor's
actual on-disk layout. Implementation lives in
[`internal/adapter/bundled/cursor/`](../../internal/adapter/bundled/cursor/);
the per-kind support declaration is in
[`capabilities.yaml`](../../internal/adapter/bundled/cursor/capabilities.yaml).

The adapter owns:

- The **`.cursor/rules/agent-sync/` reserved subtree** for rules, emitted
  as `.mdc` files.
- A **per-entry slice** of `.cursor/mcp.json` for `mcp-server-entry`
  IR nodes (under `/mcpServers/agentsync_<id>` JSON pointers), plus a
  `.cursor/.agent-sync-managed` sidecar marker.
- A **managed section** of the workspace-root `AGENTS.md` for
  `agents-md` IR nodes.

The adapter does **not** own:

- `plugin-reference` — Cursor has no project-level plugin manifest
  agent-sync can populate, so it is declared `unsupported` (see
  "Unsupported kinds" below). (`skill` is supported via the shared
  `.agents/skills/` tree; `command` via the file-leaf `.cursor/commands/`
  tree — see the table.)
- The legacy `.cursorrules` file — it is never written, migrated, or
  mutated (see "Legacy `.cursorrules`" below).
- The whole of `AGENTS.md` — the adapter writes exactly one
  agent-sync-marked section; user content and other adapters' sections
  are preserved by the ledger-driven merge (Unit 12a).
- Anything outside the paths in the table; user-authored files inside
  the same parent directories — orphan detection is scoped to
  agent-sync-emitted paths only (Unit 14 of the master plan).

## Concept → destination

| IR kind | Status | Destination | Locator | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agents-md` | supported | workspace-root `AGENTS.md` | section `agent-sync:<id>` | Section markers `<!-- agent-sync:begin id=<id> -->` … `<!-- agent-sync:end id=<id> -->`. User content outside the section is preserved. Cursor reads `AGENTS.md` directly (no companion file). |
| `rule` | supported | `.cursor/rules/agent-sync/<id>.mdc` | n/a | Managed-file header prepended. v1 emits frontmatter-less `.mdc` (the IR strips frontmatter at decode); the rule behaves as a manual / agent-requested rule until IR frontmatter exposure lands. No `paths:` ward — that is a Claude Code bug with no Cursor equivalent. |
| `mcp-server-entry` | supported | `.cursor/mcp.json` | json-pointer `/mcpServers/agentsync_<id>` | A sidecar `.cursor/.agent-sync-managed` file is written alongside `.cursor/mcp.json` because JSON has no comment syntax. |
| `skill` | supported | `.agents/skills/agent-sync-<id>/SKILL.md` (+assets) | n/a | Shared cross-tool tree (co-owned with codex/pi/antigravity; ADV-1-safe, byte-identical `SKILL.md`). Cursor reads `.agents/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`. Scope-invariant: the relative path resolves under `$HOME` at user scope. |
| `command` | supported | `.cursor/commands/<id>.md` (project) / `~/.cursor/commands/<id>.md` (user) | n/a | Emitted via the engine's `file-leaf` mode: a **flat** dir shared with the user's own command files. agent-sync owns only the individual `<id>.md` files it emits — never the dir or foreign files (a pre-existing unmanaged file at the same path fails closed, adoptable via `--adopt-prefix`). Emitted flat (no subdir): the Cursor CLI does not read command subdirectories. |
| `plugin-reference` | unsupported | n/a | n/a | Cursor does not load project-level plugin registries. Targeting `plugin-reference` at `cursor` surfaces a degradation warning and emits no files. |

## Path-verification notes

The destinations above are based on Cursor's documented project-level
discovery rules. If a future Cursor release moves or renames any of
these paths, the adapter and this table need to be updated together.

- **Rules** — Cursor reads project rules from `.cursor/rules/` as
  `.mdc` (Markdown-with-frontmatter) files and supports nested
  subdirectories, which is what makes `.cursor/rules/agent-sync/<id>.mdc`
  a valid owned subdirectory. See
  [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules).
- **`.cursor/mcp.json`** — Project-scoped MCP servers live in a flat
  `.cursor/mcp.json` file (a file, not a directory) with the
  `{"mcpServers": {"<name>": {...}}}` shape — the same shape as
  Claude's `.mcp.json`, at a different location. See
  [Cursor MCP](https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp).
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Cursor reads an `AGENTS.md` file at the project
  root (the cross-tool [agents.md](https://agents.md) convention).

## Unsupported kinds

Rather than emit dead files into directories Cursor cannot own cleanly,
the adapter declares these kinds `unsupported` and surfaces a
degradation `warning` op so the sync report names the gap honestly. No
files are written for these kinds.

- **`plugin-reference`** — Cursor has no project-level plugin manifest
  that agent-sync can populate.

> **`skill` and `command` are now supported** (both were unsupported in
> earlier releases): `skill` via the shared `.agents/skills/` tree (co-owned
> with codex/pi/antigravity); `command` via the engine's `file-leaf` mode
> into the flat `.cursor/commands/` dir. See the concept table above.

## Legacy `.cursorrules`

`.cursorrules` (a single root file) is the superseded predecessor of
the `.cursor/rules/` directory. The `cursor` adapter never writes,
migrates, or mutates `.cursorrules`.

Detecting a pre-existing `.cursorrules` and warning the user to
migrate is **not** the adapter's job: the adapter performs zero
filesystem I/O and cannot inspect the workspace (the project's
safe-filesystem layer, `internal/fsroot`, is the single enforcement
point for touching user paths). That legacy-detection warning is owned
by the sync engine (Unit 13 of the master plan), which walks the
workspace through `internal/fsroot`.

## Why `AGENTS.md` directly (not a companion)?

Cursor reads `AGENTS.md` at the project root natively, so the
`agents-md` IR kind targeted at `cursor` writes a managed section into
`AGENTS.md` itself — unlike the `claude` adapter, which routes
`agents-md` into a `CLAUDE.md` companion because Claude Code does not
read project-level `AGENTS.md`.

## User scope (`sync --user`)

The adapter is scope-aware. At user scope the scope root is `$HOME`, and the
destinations change because Cursor's user-global config differs from its
project config:

| IR kind | User-scope behavior |
|---|---|
| `mcp-server-entry` | Emitted to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` — Cursor's user-global MCP config, the same `{"mcpServers": {...}}` shape as the project file. The strict-JSON sidecar (`.agent-sync-managed`) is **suppressed**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is Cursor's own shared file, not an agent-sync-owned one. |
| `skill` | Emitted to `.agents/skills/agent-sync-<id>/` (→ `~/.agents/skills/…`), which Cursor reads at user scope. Scope-invariant — no remap needed. |
| `command` | Emitted to `.cursor/commands/<id>.md` (→ `~/.cursor/commands/<id>.md`), Cursor's user-global command dir. Scope-invariant file-leaf — no remap needed. |
| `rule` | **Skipped.** Cursor has no file-addressable user-global rules location — "User Rules" live in Cursor's settings/cloud (Customize → Rules), not a writable file. |
| `agents-md` | **Skipped.** Cursor reads `AGENTS.md` at the project root and in subdirectories only; there is no user-global `~/AGENTS.md` or `~/.cursor/AGENTS.md`. |

Skipped kinds are not silently lost: `internal/coverage` reports a per-scope
warning ("cursor has no user-global location for <kind>; sync it at project
scope instead") in the sync output and the JSON `coverage_warnings`. To apply
rules or agents-md content broadly, sync them at **project** scope. (Verified
against Cursor docs + a Cursor-staff statement, 2026-06-30; Cursor is reworking
this area in 3.9 "Customize", so a future native `~/.cursor/rules/` could change
this.)

## Multi-adapter ownership notes

- `AGENTS.md` is shared by `cursor`, `codex`, and `pi`. The
  section-marker scheme (`<!-- agent-sync:begin id=<id> -->` …
  `<!-- agent-sync:end id=<id> -->`) is identical across those adapters so
  their sections coexist. The ledger-driven merge (Unit 12a) combines
  them with user content; the per-external-file lock (Unit 12)
  serializes concurrent writers. This adapter emits exactly one
  marked section and assumes nothing about sole ownership.
- `.cursor/mcp.json` is a Cursor-only file — it is not the same file
  as Claude's workspace-root `.mcp.json`. Each tool's MCP config lives
  under its own path.
- `.cursor/rules/agent-sync/` is a Cursor-only reserved subtree.

## Exit path

To unbind agent-sync from a workspace and remove every file the `cursor`
adapter has emitted:

```bash
agent-sync unmanage cursor
```

The command (Unit 24 of the master plan, not yet shipped) uses the
ledger to remove emitted files cleanly. User-authored files inside
the same directories are preserved.
